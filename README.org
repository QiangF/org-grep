#+TITLE: org-grep â€” Kind of M-x rgrep adapted for Org mode

This tool allows for grepping files in a set of Org directories,
formatting the results as a separate Org buffer.  This buffer is
assorted with a few specific navigation commands so it works a bit
like =M-x rgrep=.  Optionally, the tool may simultaneously search
Unix mailboxes, Gnus folders, or other textual files.

** Installation

This tool has been developed on Linux, and likely requires a Unix-like
system.  Otherwise, one needs compatible *find* and *grep* tools, and a
shell able to properly decipher the arguments and establish a pipe.

To install *org-grep*, just copy =org-grep.el= somewhere Emacs may find
it.  Optionally, assign some key binding to trigger the tool.  For
one, I added these lines to my =~/.emacs= file:

  #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
    (autoload 'org-grep "org-grep" nil t)
    (define-key org-mode-map "\C-cog" 'org-grep)
  #+END_SRC

yet of course, one may choose any other key binding.

** Usage

A few Emacs variables may be set prior to, or after loading *org-grep*.
These are:

  - org-grep-directories :: This is a list of directories which the
       *org-grep* command recursively searches.  When *nil*, which is the
       default, the command searches within the hierarchy identified
       by the Org standard *org-directory* variable.
  - org-grep-extensions :: This is a list of file extensions to retain
       for the search, including the leading period.  The default is a
       list containing the =.org= string as its sole member.  If set to
       *nil*, all files are going to be searched, whatever their
       extension may be.
  - org-grep-extra-shell-commands :: This is a list of Emacs Lisp
       functions provided by the user, meant to further customize
       searching.  Such functions may be used whenever variables
       *org-grep-directories* and *org-grep-extensions* above are not
       sufficient to describe user needs.  The default is *nil*, meaning
       that there is no extra searching.  Each element in the list is
       the symbol name for the function.  Each function receives the
       regular expression given to *org-grep*, and returns a string
       holding a shell command to provide some /grep-like/ output.  See
       at the end of this section for an example.
  - org-grep-gnus-directory :: This string names the directory holding
       all Gnus mail files.  The feature is not used if the value is
       *nil*, or if the directory does not exist.  A common value is
       =~/Mail=.  When the feature is used, links from the hits buffer
       open whole messages, yet without positioning the cursor on the
       precise hit line.  The *org-grep-extra-shell-commands* mechanics
       could be used instead to get precise positioning, and more
       speed as well, but without the comfort of a proper Emacs mode.
  - org-grep-rmail-shell-commands :: This variable works similarly to
       the *org-grep-extra-shell-commands* variable, except that all
       searched files should then be Unix mailboxes.  Limitations
       about links and positioning also apply, as explained in the
       description of the *org-grep-gnus-directory* variable.

To use this tool, either call =M-x org-grep= or the keybinding put aside
for it, and reply to the =Org grep?= prompt with a regular expression to
search for.  Happily enough, Emacs and the *grep* command use rather
similar syntax for regular expressions.

Be well aware that all currently opened files in Emacs are
automatically saved to disk before that command gets executed.

This will create an Org buffer with the found lines, each preceded by
the base name of the file containing the line, and the line number
within that file.  The buffer is read-only, but standard Org commands
which do not modify the buffer apply, including of course those able
to follow links.  A few extra commands are also available:

  - C-c C-c :: For the search hit as identified by the position of the
               cursor, open the corresponding original file (unless it
               is already visited, of course), make it the current
               window, with the cursor left on that line.
  - C-x ` :: Move to the next search hit, open the corresponding
             original file, make it the current window, with the
             cursor left on the original found line.
  - . :: For the search hit as identified by the position of the
         cursor, open the corresponding original file with the cursor
         positioned on the original found line.  Leave the cursor
         within the search results window (but see [[Caveats]] below).
  - n :: Move to the next search hit, open the corresponding original
         file with the cursor positioned on the original found line.
         Leave the cursor within the search results window (but see
         [[Caveats]] below).
  - p :: Move to the previous search hit, open the corresponding
         original file with the cursor positioned on the original
         found line.  Leave the cursor within the search results
         window (but see [[Caveats]] below).
  - g :: Save all modified files to disk, then refresh the search hit
         buffer from the actual contents of the disk files.
  - c :: Copy the =*Org grep*= buffer into another Emacs buffer whose
         name depends on the regular expression.  This effectively
         saves the buffer contents before starting a new search.  The
         saved copy is a regular Org file with no specially added
         command.  Also, for convenience, all list items are turned
         into checklist items.
  - q :: Quit the =*Org grep*= window, deleting it.

In all Org buffers, command *C-x `* uses the contents of an existing
=*Org grep*= buffer for moving to the next search hit.  If that buffer
does not exist, or if there is no following hit, the standard Emacs
action is used instead: usually moving to the next compilation error.

Here is an example of using *org-grep-extra-shell-commands*.  Let's
assume that one wants to /also/ search all non-Org files under Git
control in the repository located at =~/share/bin/=.  One could use:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (setq org-grep-extra-shell-commands '(fp-org-grep-in-share-bin))

  (defun fp-org-grep-in-share-bin (regexp)
    (concat "(cd ~/share/bin; git grep -n "
            (shell-quote-argument regexp)
            " | sed 's,^,~/share/bin/,')"))
#+END_SRC

** Purpose, history

Switching to Org, I immediately populated hundreds of Org files with
data previously accumulated either as Emacs *allout* files ([[https://github.com/pinard/FP-etc/tree/master/allout-vim][or Vim!]]),
Tomboy notes or Workflowy items.  The standard Org mechanics for
searching a collection of files requires them under the control of the
Org agenda.  Given my volume of notes, Org mode was crawling, so I had
to relax the agenda and quickly develop some other mean for searching.

The first =org-grep= I wrote was based on Emacs standard =M-x rgrep=,
using hooks and other tricky machinery so it works the way I wanted.
Yet, =M-x rgrep= is limited to a single directory.  Moreover, the =*grep*=
buffer does not render Org lines as nicely as Org mode does, and this
became critical for some long Org lines using a lot of heavy markup.

So I rewrote =org-grep= with the resulting output as a genuine Org file.
This seems like a cleaner and easier way to proceed.

** Caveats

*org-grep* is constantly useful to me, yet a few minor problems remain,
which I can easily live with.  Here are those I'm aware of:

- The cursor does not come back into the resulting buffer, for some
  navigation commands meant so it does.  =(save-current-buffer ...)= or
  =(save-excursion ...)=, or even more explicit handling, all fail to
  bring the cursor back into the current window, seemingly whenever an
  Org link gets followed within the Lisp form.

- Navigation commands should reveal the goal line in the original Org
  buffer containing the grep hit, but the line stays collapsed and
  hidden.  It seems that =(org-reveal)= does not do its job.

- The search string may not be always highlighted in the resulting
  buffer, depending on its capitalization.  This is because
  =case-fold-search= is ignored by the highlighting mechanism in Emacs.
  The first letter of the pattern is recognized in both cases, this
  slightly alleviates the problem, this does not work for letters
  outside ASCII.

- It would be nice to highlight the search pattern in the original Org
  buffers containing grep hits.

- Relative links are relocated in the hits buffer so they can be
  followed, regardless of the directory they come from.  But this is
  done only for general links: those internally using double brackets.
  Implicit or explicit =file:= links, and also =rmail:= links, are the
  only ones to be so relocated.  Plain URL-like links are not
  relocated: I would need some dependable machinery to recognize them.
